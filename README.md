# FoodOrderingSystem

In this project we aim to develop an **online Food ordering system**. <br><br>
The website can be **entered as a admin/user** by providing valid
credentials or a sign-up page for new users. <br><br>
Site first **displays all the available food items** with their cost and **add to cart** feature. 
The page also supports a **search function** to search for a particular food item.<br><br>
After adding required food items to the cart a sum total is calculated
and payment options are prompted.
**status of the food** can be **observed** on site.<br><br>
The **admin** controls the **addition of food items** into the website,
**disable and enable food items** . **Add new restaurants**.<br><br>
The application aims to **automate the existing manual** process by
providing users the flexibility to order food online from the
convenience of their homes or anywhere they might be.
The application can be **used by anyone - students, families, elders,
working community etc**.
